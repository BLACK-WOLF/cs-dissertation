\chapter{Some Literature}

Dario Taraborelli, has written a nice page illustrating some of \href{http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex}{The Beauty of LaTeX} illustrating some of the finer points of TeX et.al. typesetting

\url{TeXample.net} is a site that has many spectacular examples\footnote{\url{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/}} of graphics creation in LaTeX. It mainly illustrates the use of the tikz package.

Two web sites provide forums for questions and answers on latex. \href{http://www.latex-community.org/}{LaTeX Community} and \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/}{TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange}

\section{References and searching}

\LaTeX\ and \BibTeX\ provide excellent support for referencing and citations (especially with natbib\footnote{see online manual at \url{http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natbib.pdf} or with the command \texttt{texdoc natbib}}).  Getting your .bib file populated with material can be time consuming. Among the many ways of doing this are:
\begin{itemize}
\item    Search engines like the University Library allow you to export your saved searched in a bibTeX file
\item    Google scholar https://scholar.google.co.uk/ have an option to create the BibTeX entry for results.
\item    Zotero provides a plugin for Firefox, that extracts information from a web page and exports a bibTeX file. (Great for getting references to Wikipedia, or getting book details from Amazon)
\end{itemize}

These are great, but sometimes the bibTeX file needs a little post-editing. Usually I end up deleting extraneous fields and escaping TeX characters if needed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Search for articles, books etc, grab the bibTeX file,
\item \verb"\backslash cite{}"and use
\item \verb"\bibliography{save1,litrev,canon}" with
\item \verb"\bibliographystyle{plainnat}" (having \verb"\usepackage{natbib}" in the preamble)...
\end{enumerate}
 Harvard referencing of your material... job done
