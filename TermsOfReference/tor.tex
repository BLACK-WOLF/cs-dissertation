\section{Background}
Computer graphics is a topic that has always greatly interested me, especially when it comes to real-time rendering.
I have always wanted to know how software such as game engines, 3D modelers, and other similar computer graphics software work.
As an aspiring computer scientist, I strive to learn how such software is not only created, but also designed. 
I want to learn just how a rendering engine is developed in a software engineering perspective, and to also learn the core components
of real time rendering.
A real-time engine display three-dimensional data as images on the computer at an interactive display rate. The display rate is mesaured in frames per second(fps), however for a real-timer renderer the fps should be higher than 15fps for it to be considered smooth.
Real-time renderes are very important for visualing 3D scenes and enviroment, it takes a great deal of knowledge, and patience to run these computationaly complex software to run consumer grade hardware. It also has you learn how to work with a Graphical Processing Unit(GPU), aswell as the Central Processing Unit(CPU).
I will be exposed to new concepts such as how lighting, and shadows are implemented in a renderer.
\section{Proposed Work}
I will be using C++ as my programming language of choice,and OpenGL which is a graphics API that will allow me to create graphics progra
The goal for creating a rendeirng engine is to manage graphical effects, such as lighting, shadows, texture mapping, and to apply them to a 3D scene and have them interact with other 3D objects. A rendering engine should not be confused with a game engine which would have me implement a physics system, and an animation system aswell.

I wish to build an engine with a 3D scene that will showcase various graphics effects. I want to be able to move around the 3D space using a camera, so i can be able to look at the scene at different perspective.I want to be able to turn toggle of, and on certain features to be able to show what the scene will look like without them, for example toggling off shadows to show how they may impact the scene visually.
